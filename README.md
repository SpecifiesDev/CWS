# CWS - Computer Web Server

## What is it?

CWS is an application I designed to communicate with a web server I hosted on an old computer. This repository is a complete rework of the program I built for myself. What you're seeing is a redesign of an already fully functional program. For the time being, I am creating this program for three reasons. To further my web development skills (primarily styling), to make a personal program I made for myself more functional for friends and I, and to further familiarize myself with secure node practices.

## Plans?

I don't like setting a set "plan" for a program, because many things change between the start of development to the end of it. With that being said, I will provide a loose description of where I want to go with this program:

* Fully functional file system. I designed my original application to access static youtube videos, json files, and txt files. What I hope to do is to implement some system of viewing certain files (.pdf, etc) and the one's that aren't supported you can just download.

* Authentication system. I know, this is vague. I want to create an authentication system that pulls specific data from a user to confirm it's them. I'll explain more once I've developed this thought more.

* Modifications. A page where people can locally modify their application through the UI. It would clearly be more limited than actually diving into the code, but cool nevertheless.

## Anything else?

Just know that this repository isn't a complete collection of the application. I will be keeping some source private (mainly backend) for obvious reasons.

A video of this application running will be posted in due time.

Thanks for your time,

Austin.
